### 📄 example_code.cpp

🔴 **Line 10** [memory-safety] Memory leak - dynamically allocated array never deleted

> Array 'data' is allocated with 'new[]' on line 10 but no corresponding 'delete[]'. Memory leak on every execution.

🔴 **Line 27** [memory-safety] Missing destructor - memory leak on object destruction

> Class 'DataProcessor' has dynamically allocated memory but no destructor. This leads to a memory leak when the object is destroyed.

🟡 **Line 23** [performance] Pass by value instead of reference or pointer

> Function 'processData' takes its argument by value. This creates a copy of the vector which can be expensive for large vectors. Use pass-by-reference (&) or pass-by-pointer (*).

🟡 **Line 23** [modern-cpp] Use range-based for loop instead of traditional for loop

> The traditional 'for' loop is less readable and can lead to off-by-one errors. The range-based 'for' loop (range-for) is more modern C++ and safer.
