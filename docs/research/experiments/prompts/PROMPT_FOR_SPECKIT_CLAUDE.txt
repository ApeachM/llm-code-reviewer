I have a production-ready LLM-powered C++ code analysis framework that needs validation through a large-scale PR analysis experiment.

**Project location:**
/home/baum/workspace/claude-home/cpp-llm-reviewer

**Current status:**
- ✅ Phase 0-5 completed (83/84 tests passing, 98.8%)
- ✅ Large file support with AST-based chunking
- ✅ PR analysis capability implemented
- ✅ CLI interface ready
- ✅ All dependencies installed in venv/

**Your task:**
Run a comprehensive large-scale PR analysis experiment to validate the system works on realistic multi-file pull requests (10+ files, 300+ lines changed).

**Step-by-step instructions:**
Please read and follow the detailed guide at:
```
/home/baum/workspace/claude-home/cpp-llm-reviewer/docs/experiments/INSTRUCTION_FOR_SPECKIT_CLAUDE.md
```

**What you'll do (summary):**
1. Create a branch: `experiment/synthetic-large-pr-2024`
2. Generate 15 C++ files with intentional issues (memory leaks, buffer overflows, etc.)
3. Commit the files as a synthetic PR
4. Run PR analysis: `python3 -m cli.main analyze pr --base main --head experiment/synthetic-large-pr-2024 --chunk`
5. Evaluate results (detection rate, false positives, performance)
6. Document findings in `experiments/large-pr/EXPERIMENT_SUMMARY.md`

**Expected outcome:**
- Analysis completes within 10 minutes
- Finds 60-80% of intentional issues (~80-100 out of 120-150)
- Generates actionable markdown report
- Validates system is production-ready

**Timeline:** ~50-60 minutes total

**Important notes:**
- The framework is already fully implemented - you're just running validation
- Focus on measuring and documenting results
- If you encounter issues, debug them (the system is stable)
- Use the "Synthetic PR" approach (faster and more controlled than real OSS)

**Deliverables:**
1. Branch with 15 test files
2. Analysis report: `experiments/large-pr/synthetic-pr-analysis.md`
3. Summary document: `experiments/large-pr/EXPERIMENT_SUMMARY.md`
4. Performance metrics and recommendations

Please start by reading the instruction file and confirming you understand the task.
