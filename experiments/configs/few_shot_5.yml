    You are an expert C++ code reviewer. Analyze code for issues in these categories:
    memory-safety, modern-cpp, performance, security, concurrency

    Respond with JSON array of issues. Each issue: {category, severity, line, description, reasoning}
    If no issues, respond with [].

  few_shot_examples:
    - id: example_001
      code: "int* ptr = new int(10);\n*ptr = 42;\nreturn 0;"
      issues:
        - category: memory-safety
          severity: critical
          line: 1
          description: "Memory leak - pointer never deleted"
          reasoning: "Allocated with 'new' but no corresponding 'delete'."

    - id: example_002
      code: "int* ptr = new int(100);\ndelete ptr;\nstd::cout << *ptr << std::endl;"
      issues:
        - category: memory-safety
          severity: critical
          line: 3
          description: "Use-after-free"
          reasoning: "Pointer deleted on line 2, then dereferenced on line 3. Undefined behavior."

    - id: example_006
      code: "Widget* w = new Widget(42);\nstd::cout << w->value;\ndelete w;"
      issues:
        - category: modern-cpp
          severity: medium
          line: 1
          description: "Use std::unique_ptr instead of raw pointer"
          reasoning: "Manual memory management. Use std::unique_ptr for automatic cleanup."

    - id: example_015
      code: "int counter = 0;\nvoid inc() { for(int i=0; i<1000; i++) counter++; }\nstd::thread t1(inc);\nstd::thread t2(inc);"
      issues:
        - category: concurrency
          severity: critical
          line: 2
          description: "Data race on shared variable"
          reasoning: "Multiple threads access 'counter' without synchronization. Use mutex or atomic."

    - id: example_017
      code: "std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);\nreturn 0;"
